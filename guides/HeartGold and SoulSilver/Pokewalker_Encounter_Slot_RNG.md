```
Note: This guide assumes that you have some knowledge of gen 4 retail RNG already. It is highly recommended that you have completed at least 1 gen 4 Egg RNG, and have successfully hit an initial seed on eontiemr, before attempting this.
```

## Required Tools
- A Pokewalker: Pokewalkers need CR 2032 watch batteries, which can be found at most convenience stores. Be sure your Pokewalker is paired with the HGSS cartridge you plan to RNG with.   
- [Eontimer] or [Flowtimer]: Eontimer is recommended if you can use it, though flowtimer would work about as well, if you knew what you were doing with it. I believe there are online versions of eontimer, but those may not be as effective for this RNG. 
[Lappy's Pokewalker RNG Google Sheets Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J0fD1pzn5EW3XjzKpW-ubcZ3nUAI8A6bEzt2n1ZWecU/edit?usp=sharing): Until a proper substitute is developed, a copy of my google sheets will be necessary for IRNG optimization.
## Optional Items For Convenience 
- A Non-3DS: The 3DS cannot reach years 2051-2099, and year is essential to Pokewalker RNG. You will be more limited on spreads using a 3DS than anything else. Also, target second is extremely crucial to hitting the initial seed, and the 3DS isn't exactly good at doing that on command. 
- A 3DS with CFW: The 3DS can be useful for other purposes, if it has CFW. People have and are continuing to create programs that can allow the 3DS to interact with and manipulate the pokewalker. It is still a work-in-progress, but watt injection can be done through the 3DS, with some minor hiccups.
- Twilight++: That said, the 3DS cannot currently use it's own infrared to connect to the pokewalker. it instead must use the IR from a HG or SS cart, which Twilight++ can do. 
- Checkpoint: Useful to avoid releasing large amounts of pokemon, but otherwise not a super important part of the RNG. 
- Lincoln/Porycyon Tools: **This stuff should probably go on a reseed or event pokemon guide. Move it there when one is created**
- A Palm m500, updated to Palm OS 4.1: This may seem like a weird one, and believe me it is, but until code for 3DS CFW is free from certain "side effects", the Palm is the safest way to inject watts, steps, items, and event pokemon.
- [WalkePoker](https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&proj=28.%20pokewalker), by dmitrygr: Dmitry's Palm OS app is capable of injecting watts, steps, items, and custom event pokemon, which can be RNGed. The ROM dump doesn't seem to work, I'd advise against using it. If nothing else, this will save you time grinding watts, if you're willing to invest in this RNG.
