```
Note: This guide assumes that you have some knowledge of gen 4 retail RNG already. It is highly recommended that you have completed at least 1 gen 4 Egg RNG, and have successfully hit an initial seed on eontiemr, before attempting this.
Note 2: If this guide is rewritten with Aprijuice tech, no RNG experience will be necessary, just a bit of time and effort. Unsure when that will happen though.
